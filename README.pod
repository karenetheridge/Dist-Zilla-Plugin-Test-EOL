=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

This plugin accepts the following options:

=head2 C<trailing_whitespace>

If this option is set to a true value,
C<< { trailing_whitespace => 1 } >> will be passed to
L<Test::EOL/all_perl_files_ok>. It defaults to C<1>.

What this option is going to do is test for the lack of trailing whitespace at
the end of the lines (also known as "trailing space").

=head2 C<filename>

The filename of the test to add - defaults to F<xt/author/test-eol.t>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This module is a fork of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests> and was originally
written by Florian Ragwitz. It was forked because the Test:: namespace
is preferred for test modules, and because I would prefer to have EOL tests
be Author tests.
